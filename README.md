### Hi, I'm Summer! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer and designer who specializes in Elixir. I spend a lot of time playing with graphics, especially SVGs, and making art. I'm currently using the [Processing](https://processing.org/) language and framework to make SVGs that I can draw with my [AxiDraw pen plotter](https://shop.evilmadscientist.com/productsmenu/846). Mostly this serves as an excuse to add to my very large collection of gel pens.
